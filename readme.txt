For my final project, to add to the holiday spirit, I decided to do something interactive and festive with p5. This interactive project consists of greetings, snowflakes, a built-in webcam, and even a santa hat! When your name is entered into the box, it is dispalyed in random spots on the canvas, and also lights up in different colors. During the completion of this project, I wanted to in incorporate some holiday music into the sketch, but I couldn't get the music file to upload or play. Nonetheless, I tried diffeent things to make this project better.
